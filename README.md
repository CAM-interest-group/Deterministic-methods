# Deterministic-methods

This holds our analysis of Depth first search(and exhaustive search) and branch and bound methods. Hopefully we will also

There are a few branches. The one has the images or the time plots. The other has the permutation csv files that are smaller than 9 (10 and 11 are much larger than 25 MB)

The QAP deterministic final has the incorrect fitness function
